                Mockups are used in various projects to share with various teams
                throughout Ascend Learning. The Instructional Designers,
                Writers, QA, and Animation/Design teams refer to these mockups
                when creating and reviewing the motion graphics throughout the
                sim. Here are a couple of small projects that are a part of a
                larger project I'm currently working on based on health issues.

                <p>
                    This project helps users identify environmental health
                    triggers by engaging in a simulated conversation between a
                    nurse and a family discovering what could be causing their
                    family's respiratory issues.

                <h3>Engage Community Health: Violence and Abuse</h3>
                <p>
                    This project focuses on abuse that the youth and elderly may
                    encounter at school or where they live. Users will go
                    through a simulated conversation that showcases the proper
                    steps they need to take when they know someone experiencing
                    abuse.
