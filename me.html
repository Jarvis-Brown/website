                    <h3>Hello!</h3>
                    <p>
                        I'm an Animator and a Fullstack Designer in
                        Philadelphia, PA with roots in St. Louis, MO. I'm
                        passionate about working on designs and animations that
                        improve lives and have a positive social impact. I
                        design in a human-centric way, incorporating user
                        research and practical choices for user interfaces. I
                        draw design inspiration from my favorite brands and
                        trends, using my Master's in Fine Arts, to add a
                        creative touch to everything I do.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Animation Work</h3>
                    <p>
                        Early on in life, I knew I wanted to be an artist and
                        bring my drawings to life in a digital format. I started
                        my career in animation after completing my studies at
                        the Chicago Illinois Institute of the Arts. I traveled
                        from Chicago to San Francisco in pursuit of animation
                        and received my MFA from the Academy of Art. Afterward,
                        I moved between LA and the Bay Area working on various
                        projects before moving to New York where I've worked as
                        a character animator and motion graphics designer for
                        the last 6 years.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Design Work</h3>
                    <p>
                        After working in the Animation field for 8 years, I
                        decided to pursue a career as a Fullstack Designer to
                        grow my artistic skillset further. I attended the
                        CareerFoundry to gain certification in UI Design and
                        have been currently working on projects to diversify my
                        portfolio. After completing certification I attended
                        Coding Dojo to gain certification in Fullstack
                        Development.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Hobbies</h3>
                    <p>
                        In my downtime, I enjoy gaming, swimming, painting,
                        drawing, and researching the newest techniques in
                        digital art. On any given weekend I can be found walking
                        around my newest city, visiting museums, and finding
                        inspiration in the world around me.
